## About the project

This project was made for a test by Cidade Alta.

This is a simple project where users can register and redeem some badges if they manage to solve the challenge.
I didn't have access to any UI to develop, I had some descriptions of what the system was. So I had to use my creativity, and I looked for inspiration on the current Cidade Alta website.

So that's it, folks! ❤️
